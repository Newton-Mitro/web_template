        In the current economic situation, it is almost impossible to get
        sufficient surety for any loan. Due to this situation members are unable
        to secure new loans from Dhaka Credit. Hence, Dhaka Credit has launched
        a new product “Double Loan on Fixed Deposit” which is targeting members
        who have sufficient Fixed Deposit but are unable to secure surety for
        loan.
