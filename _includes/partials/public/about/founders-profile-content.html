        Cross on September in 1923, and joined in the first verse in 1925 &
        accepted his blessing in 1928. In 1929, he obtained his BA degree from

        theory of Theism at the Foreign Mission seminary in Washington, he was
        promoted as a Priest at Indiana Notre Dame University chapel. And in the
        same year he came to Bangladesh as a foreign missionary and did various
        pastoral and social activities in Dhaka and Mymensingh. In 1953,

        His philosophy in credit movement has spread widely throughout the
        country. This theory brings radical changes in peopleâ€™s lives. Later,
        using this theory, the non-governmental organization Grameen Bank won
        the Nobel Peace Prize. Many organizations of the country are working in
        the light of this theory. The Christian Co-Operative Credit Union Ltd.
        Dhaka is now the largest Credit Union in South Asia of its kind. The
        name of Fr. Charles J. Young CSC will be written in the history of
        Credit Movement of this region. He died on 14 November 1988 in a tragic
        road accident. He was buried in Tejgaon Holy Rosary Church in Dhaka. His
        death anniversary is being celebrated every year with due honor.
